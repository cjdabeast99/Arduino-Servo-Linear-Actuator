# Arduino-Servo-Linear-Actuator
Using an arduino to control a Servo motor using 3D printed pieces to create a mini linear actuator.


# Instructions
[Follow this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vAoOYF3m8U) for instructions on assembly of the linear actuator 3D printed pieces connecting to the servo motor.
The YouTuber also has their own version of the code that can be used if desired.

I have an LED connected to my breadboard to assist with knowing the direction of the servo motor.
